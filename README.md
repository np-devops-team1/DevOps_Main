## Flake8 Linting Guide

- files that contain this line are skipped:
  `# flake8: noqa`

- lines that contain a `# noqa` comment at the end will not issue warnings.

- use `flake8` to invoke flake8 for all working files in directory, or `flake8 <filename>.py` for a specific file

- flake8 linting configuration can be changed in the `.flake8` file, but changing it is not advisable

## Setting Up Project

### Create Virtual Environment

To create a virtual environment locally, within the project folder, type

```sh
python -m venv dev_env
```

Make sure that the venv follows the same name so git ignores the venv folder.

### Virtual Environment Commands

```sh
# Entering virtual environment
.\dev_env\Scripts\activate

# Installing dependencies from requirements.txt
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# Exit virutal environment
deactivate
```

### Installing New Dependencies

Whenever a new dependency is required for the project, the requirements.txt file has to be updated. To do this, simply type:

```sh
python -m pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
